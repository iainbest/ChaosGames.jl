# Chaos Games

A simple bit of code to generate fractal patterns from a (regular) polygon. 

Includes restriction rules to change the games.

Includes basic plot recipe, to be expanded on.

## To Do:
- clean up restriction code: naming, saving of unnecessary history of previous chosen vertices, ...
- option of generic (non-regular) polygon for the game
- simple plots and examples in repo examples folder and readme
- example code, simple explanation of basic algorithm in readme
- split code into several sections, including but not limited to:
  - generation of initial polygon, getting relevant info out
  - rules for chaos game (how to choose next vertex, next point to plot,...)
  - simple plotting (and animations?)
  - driving code (probably remain in src/ChaosGame.jl)
  - install/clone instructions for readme
- and more probably
